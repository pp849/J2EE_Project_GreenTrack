REST API Layer 
The REST API layer in the GreenTrack project is designed to handle HTTP requests related to user interactions, event management, and eco-friendly activities, while ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. We have achieved it by creating EventRestController, UserRestController and AdminRestController. The API uses Spring MVC to handle the requests and Spring Boot to manage the applicationâ€™s configuration and dependencies.
